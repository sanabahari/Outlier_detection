# Outlier_Detection
The dataset for this project is related to Heart Disease Data given by University of California Irvine (UCI).
This dataset has 14 attributes e.g. age, sex, chest pain type (4 values), resting blood pressure, etc. 
The purpose of this project is to detect the outliers in dataset, which adversely affects the generation of machine learning models. 
In this project I used different techniques for outlier detection which include: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) , Angle-Based Outlier Detection (ABOD), Cluster Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF). 
Finally, I visualized results of outlier detection models for two variables : “chol” ,” trestbps”.
